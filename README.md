Ball Tracking Robot
______________________________________________________________________________
We built a robot that utilizes the AudrinoUno board in conjunction with OpenCV to locate green pit balls.
The robot itself was programmed to only find green pitballs and no other color. The success of OpenCV lies where you can configure it to only locate specific objects. Thanks to openCV we were able to design a robot that only tracks the color,shape and size of the item we needed it to track.
